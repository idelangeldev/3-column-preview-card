## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge was to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I can easily adapt a flexbox element or group of elements for any screen size. I'm still not confident about more complex designs, but I know that eventually I'll get there.

### Continued development

I'm still confused about how to position a div into the middle of the screen, unless I use 100vh as height. But really, the problem starts when making my site responsive , especially when theres a div within a div (e.g. a horizontal rectangle within another horizontal rectangle)... I'll keep studying and ask around if I get lost.
